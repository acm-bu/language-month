Hello, world! this is the puzzle description written in an mdx file!

```ts
export const myFunction = () => {
  console.log("Syntax highlighting should be working")
}
```

- also
- we 
- have
- lists


1. and
2. numbered
3. lists


# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4

Honestly, anything past h4 is just plain ridiculous and evidence that you should really restructure your content. We can do *italics* for emphasis and **bold** for much stronger emphasis.

In the middle of a sentence, we may want to do `code` and then just continue on with life.

Sometimes, we may also want to link to somewhere else, like just an [example link](https://google.com) to google.
