Today we're gonna be talking about functions. 

# Functions

You can simply define a function like such:


```ts
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 0;
  } else if (n === 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
  }
}

const result = fibonacci(10);
```


You can also define functions anonymously. In javascript, functions are just variables that can be passed around like anything else. Here's an example:

```ts

const myFunction = () => {

}

```

This means that you can have functions that take other functions as input, or functions that return another function as output. You typically don't have to worry about scope. As a rule, if the variable is less indented than your function, you can use it. This allows for effective use of the [closure pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)).
